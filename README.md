# HappyTails - Web Application

The main purpose of this project is to automate the process of serving the welfare of the pets by giving the abandoned pets a place of shelter to live in, and care for them with affection through our portal. 



## Appendix

Focusing on the audiences who want to adopt any pet like a dog, or cat will get the information and contact details about the welfare near them. We have added many enticing modules and segments in our web application to allure visitors and lead them to adopt their dream pets.
